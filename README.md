👋 Hi, I’m @wjkoh

If you read a lot at work, SumUp (https://sumup.page) makes web articles easier to understand using AI. I was intrigued by Large Language Models like GPT-3 and built the app to test their capacity. It helps me to get the gist of an article faster and easier. Please try and let me know what you think!
